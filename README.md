## Notes

* The 60% layout has not been tested yet! I only own the macro + 65 percent versions of the PCBs. Please double check the dimensions before using. The screw holes *should* be the same in all versions.
* The photos show the split "wall" rising up into the top part of the case. This was removed as it tends to rattle.
* Designed to use M3 bolts and brass heat set inserts.
